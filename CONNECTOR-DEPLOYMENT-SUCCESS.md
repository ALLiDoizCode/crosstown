## 🐛 **Issues Resolved**

### Missing Express Dependency

**Problem:** Connector v1.19.0 image missing Express package required for HTTP APIs

**Error:**
```
express is required for HTTP admin/health APIs. Install it with: npm install express
```

**Solution:** Created `connector:patched` image with Express 4.x

**Dockerfile:**
```dockerfile
FROM connector:latest
WORKDIR /app
RUN npm install express@4
```

## 🧪 **Test Results**

### Infrastructure Tests

✅ **Connector Health:** `{"status":"healthy","version":"1.2.1","peersConnected":0}`
✅ **Crosstown Health:** `{"status":"healthy","bootstrapPhase":"ready","peerCount":0}`
✅ **Payment Channels:** `GET /admin/channels` returns `[]` (infrastructure enabled)
✅ **Settlement Monitor:** `GET /admin/settlement/states` returns `[]` (monitoring active)
✅ **Relay Events:** Bootstrap ILP peer info (kind 10032) stored and retrievable

### Event Storage Test

```bash
bash tests/event-storage-test.sh
```

**Results:**
- ✅ Core infrastructure verified
- ✅ BLS accessible and validating payments
- ✅ Relay serving events via WebSocket
- ✅ TOON format encoding working
- ⚠️ Direct BLS writes require TOON-encoded events (JSON rejected as expected)
