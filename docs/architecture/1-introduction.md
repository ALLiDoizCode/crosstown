# 1. Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for **Agent Society Protocol**, including the core library packages, shared services, and integration patterns. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
This project is a library with no user interface. No separate Frontend Architecture Document is required.

## 1.1 Starter Template or Existing Project

**Decision:** No starter template. This is a greenfield TypeScript library project using standard npm/TypeScript monorepo tooling configured manually.

**Rationale:** Specialized library with unique Nostr + ILP requirements. Manual setup provides complete control over tooling without removing unnecessary boilerplate.
