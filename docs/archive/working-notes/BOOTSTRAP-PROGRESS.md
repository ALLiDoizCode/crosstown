# Nostr SPSP Bootstrap Implementation - Progress Report

## Status: 🟡 IN PROGRESS - Docker Image Rebuilding

## What We've Built

### 1. HTTP Connector Clients ✅
- **`http-connector-admin.ts`** - Admin API client for peer registration
- **`http-runtime-client.ts`** - Runtime client for sending ILP packets
- **`http-channel-client.ts`** - Channel client for payment channel operations
- Location: `packages/core/src/bootstrap/`

### 2. Bootstrap Entrypoint ✅
- **`entrypoint-with-bootstrap.ts`** - Complete Crosstown node with bootstrap
- Integrates:
  * BLS (Business Logic Server)
  * Nostr Relay
  * CrosstownNode with BootstrapService
  * SPSP request/response handlers
  * Payment channel negotiation
- Location: `packages/bls/src/`

### 3. SPSP Security ✅ CONFIRMED
- **NIP-44 Encryption**: All SPSP events are encrypted end-to-end
- **sharedSecret Protection**: Never exposed in plaintext
- **ILP Packet Transport**: SPSP events sent as TOON-encoded ILP PREPARE/FULFILL data

### 4. Docker Configuration ✅
- **`docker-compose-bootstrap.yml`** - Multi-peer bootstrap network
- Genesis peer (peer1) with `SPSP_MIN_PRICE=0` for free handshakes
- Joiner peers (peer2-4) with `BOOTSTRAP_RELAYS` and `BOOTSTRAP_PEERS`
- Uses `ENTRYPOINT=entrypoint-with-bootstrap.js` environment variable

### 5. Test Documentation ✅
- **`BOOTSTRAP-TEST-PLAN.md`** - Comprehensive 6-phase test plan
- **`test-bootstrap-flow.sh`** - Automated test script
- Verification commands for each phase

## Issues Fixed

### TypeScript Compilation
- ✅ Type mismatches in HTTP clients (accepted vs type)
- ✅ Missing type annotations
- ✅ Import path errors
- ✅ Environment variable access errors
- ✅ ConfigError argument mismatches
- ✅ Missing package dependencies
- ✅ NostrEvent import conflicts
- ✅ HandlePacketRequest/Response type conflicts

### Docker Build
- ✅ Docker space issue (freed 7.9GB with cleanup)
- ✅ Connector image version mismatch (fixed 1.19.1 → 1.19.2)
- ✅ Crosstown image tag (fixed optimized → bootstrap)

### Configuration
- ✅ **genesis-peers.json conflict** - Empty array to prevent dummy peer interference
- ✅ Peer2 secret key updated to avoid collision with dummy genesis peer

## Current State

### Build Status
- **@crosstown/core**: ✅ Built successfully
- **@crosstown/bls**: ✅ Built successfully (includes entrypoint-with-bootstrap.js)
- **Docker Image**: ⏳ Rebuilding with updated genesis-peers.json
  - Task ID: bc3d303
  - Status: Running
  - Expected completion: ~5-10 minutes

### Network Status
- **Anvil**: Running (contracts deployed)
- **Token Faucet**: Running
- **Genesis Peer (peer1)**: Not running (waiting for new image)
- **Joiner Peer (peer2)**: Not running (waiting for new image)

## Next Steps

### 1. Complete Docker Build ⏳
- Wait for image rebuild to complete
- Verify bootstrap entrypoint is included

### 2. Start Bootstrap Network 📋
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-bootstrap.yml down -v
docker-compose -f docker-compose-bootstrap.yml up -d
```

### 3. Test Bootstrap Flow 📋
```bash
bash test-bootstrap-flow.sh
```

### 4. Verify Each Phase 📋

#### Phase 1: Genesis Startup
- [ ] Genesis publishes kind:10032
- [ ] Relay starts on port 7100
- [ ] SPSP server ready with minPrice=0
- [ ] Running as bootstrap node

#### Phase 2: Joiner Discovery
- [ ] Peer2 connects to genesis relay (ws://crosstown-peer1:7100)
- [ ] Peer2 discovers genesis kind:10032 event
- [ ] Bootstrap service enters discovery phase

#### Phase 3: SPSP Handshake
- [ ] Peer2 sends encrypted SPSP request (kind:23194)
- [ ] Genesis receives and decrypts request
- [ ] Genesis negotiates settlement chain
- [ ] Genesis opens payment channel via connector Admin API
- [ ] Genesis sends encrypted SPSP response (kind:23195)
- [ ] Peer2 receives and decrypts response
- [ ] Peer2 extracts sharedSecret and channelId
- [ ] Peer2 registers BTP peer using SPSP sharedSecret
- [ ] BTP connection established

#### Phase 4: Announcement
- [ ] Peer2 publishes own kind:10032 to genesis relay
- [ ] Genesis RelayMonitor discovers peer2

#### Phase 5: Packet Routing
- [ ] Send test event from peer1 → peer2
- [ ] Packet routes through BTP (NOT local delivery)
- [ ] Signed claims generated
- [ ] Settlement tracking updated

#### Phase 6: Settlement Trigger
- [ ] Send enough packets to exceed threshold (5000 units)
- [ ] Settlement triggers automatically
- [ ] On-chain transaction confirmed
- [ ] Wallet balances updated
- [ ] Payment channel balances updated

## Expected Behavior

### Genesis Peer Logs
```
✅ Nostr relay started on port 7100
✅ SPSP server started
✅ ILP info published successfully
✅ Running as bootstrap node
```

### Joiner Peer Logs
```
✅ Querying ws://crosstown-peer1:7100 for peer info
✅ Peer discovered: 9c8e6a...
✅ SPSP request sent
✅ SPSP response received
✅ Payment channel opened: ch-...
✅ BTP peer registered with SPSP secret
```

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **SPSP as ILP Packets**: SPSP events are TOON-encoded and travel in ILP PREPARE/FULFILL data fields
2. **NIP-44 Encryption**: End-to-end encryption for SPSP request/response, sharedSecret never exposed
3. **Payment Channel Negotiation**: Happens during SPSP handshake via `negotiateAndOpenChannel()`
4. **BTP Authentication**: Uses sharedSecret from SPSP response instead of hardcoded env vars
5. **Local Delivery**: Internal-only (connector → BLS), not used for peer routing
6. **Genesis Peers**: Cleared dummy data to prevent conflicts with actual bootstrap config
