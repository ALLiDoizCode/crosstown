    status: PASS
    notes: "Secret key never logged, validated for format, normalized to lowercase. Public key derived and displayed instead."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Config loading is one-time startup operation. No performance concerns."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Fail-fast on invalid config with descriptive error messages. Catches both ConfigError and PricingError in entrypoint."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean separation: config.ts for parsing, entrypoint.ts for orchestration. Reuses existing pricing config module. Well-typed BlsEnvConfig interface."
