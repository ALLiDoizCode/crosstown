    notes: 'No secrets in logs, health check over local network only, settlement addresses stored in memory not logged'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Health check polling runs once at startup only. setTimeout-based retry avoids overlapping requests.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Proper timeout handling in waitForAgentRuntime, non-fatal settlement warnings, BigInt parse with error handling'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Follows established patterns from prior stories, clean separation of concerns, co-located tests, good JSDoc'
