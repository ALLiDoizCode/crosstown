  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Implements runtime defense layers 8-10 (rate limiting, content sanitization, audit logging) with proper SQLite persistence, prepared statements, and comprehensive test coverage. No security vulnerabilities identified.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Prepared statements used for all hot-path operations, proper database indexing on frequently queried columns, synchronous SQLite operations provide optimal performance.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Synchronous SQLite operations with proper error boundaries, resource lifecycle management (close() methods), :memory: mode for tests, file-based mode for production.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean, well-documented code with comprehensive test coverage (>80%), proper type safety (no any types), follows all coding standards, independently testable components.'
