  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No secrets handled, pubkey validation reuses proven validators, wallet management delegated to caller"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Sequential tx fetches acceptable for MVP (100 tx limit), no caching needed yet"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Read path: graceful degradation with console.warn on all failure modes. Write path: PeerDiscoveryError with cause chain. Individual tx failures skipped without breaking iteration."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Follows GenesisPeerLoader const-object pattern, reuses shared validators, well-typed GraphQL response interfaces, co-located tests"
