nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No new attack surfaces. Admin API URL from env var, NOSTR_SECRET_KEY validated, no secrets logged. ADDITIONAL_PEERS validated by BootstrapService internally."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Sequential bootstrap appropriate for startup. SocialPeerDiscovery has configurable cooldown. 500ms relay warmup is pre-existing pattern."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Bootstrap failures non-fatal (returns successful results only). Social discovery errors isolated per-peer. Graceful shutdown in correct order: social → SPSP → relay → BLS."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean separation of exported utility functions for testability. VITEST env guard prevents auto-execution. Follows established connector admin client interface from core."
