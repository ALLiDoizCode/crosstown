    notes: "NOSTR_SECRET_KEY uses env var substitution (never hardcoded). .env covered by root .gitignore. No secrets in committed files."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "N/A — documentation/configuration only. Health check intervals and restart policy are appropriate for production."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Health check with start_period ensures BLS is ready before dependents start. restart: unless-stopped provides automatic recovery."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Well-commented compose file, clear .env.example with generation instructions, README provides both quickstart and integration paths."
