  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All 7 prompt injection defense layers implemented: XML tag isolation, datamarking, instruction boundary, sandwich defense, output format lock, Zod schema validation, action allowlist enforcement. Untrusted content never processed raw."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "9.79KB ESM bundle. Handler markdown cached by HandlerLoader. Bounded retry (max 2 LLM calls per event)."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "NoOutputGeneratedError handled with retry+escalation. Non-NoOutputGeneratedError re-thrown. HandlerNotFoundError propagated. Unhandled kinds short-circuit without LLM call."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean separation: prompt-builder (31 lines) handles content isolation, handler (104 lines) handles orchestration. Factory functions in tests reduce boilerplate. All public APIs exported from barrel."
