  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Events signed with node secret key, BigInt pricing prevents overflow, no raw user input in ILP packets'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Linear in peer count (typically 1-3), no retry on announce failure (correct design)'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Non-fatal announce failures with event emission and WARNING logging, catch block handles both REJECT and thrown exceptions'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Follows existing DI pattern for TOON encoding, basePricePerByte configurable with sensible default, event types added to existing union type'
