nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No code changes. peerAddress flows through NIP-44 encrypted channels. Admin API endpoints are internal-only.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No code changes. All 1022 tests pass in ~4s.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Graceful degradation verified — missing peerAddress returns basic SPSP response instead of failing.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean separation: negotiateAndOpenChannel() handles shared logic, NostrSpspServer delegates to it, createChannelClient() handles HTTP transport. Cross-repo requirements well-documented.'
