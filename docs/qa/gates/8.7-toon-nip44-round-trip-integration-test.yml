nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Uses real NIP-44 cryptography (no mocked encryption). Keypairs generated fresh per test. No secrets hardcoded or leaked.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Tests execute in ~115ms total. No external dependencies or network calls.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Tests are deterministic — fresh keypairs per test, no shared state, no flaky external dependencies.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Tests follow AAA pattern with clear comments. Each test is self-contained and well-documented.'
