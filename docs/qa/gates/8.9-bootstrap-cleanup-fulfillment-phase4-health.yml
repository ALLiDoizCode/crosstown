    notes: "Fulfillment removal is safe — agent-runtime already computes own fulfillment. Health endpoint exposes only operational counts."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Closure-based counters are O(1). No measurable overhead added."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Health endpoint gracefully handles missing getBootstrapCounts and non-ready phases."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "@deprecated JSDoc on generateFulfillment signals intent. Optional fulfillment field is backward compatible."
