nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'SPSP min price is opt-in, scoped to kind:23194, does not bypass signature verification or owner bypass ordering. Only lowers price floor, never raises it.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Single boolean evaluation and bigint comparison added to payment path — negligible overhead.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Config validation covers all edge cases (negative, non-integer). Undefined default preserves existing behavior. Both BLS packages identically mirrored.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean code with JSDoc, local SPSP_REQUEST_KIND constant, destructuring pattern for config access. Follows established coding standards.'
