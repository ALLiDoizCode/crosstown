  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No user input reaches SQL. Prepared statements used throughout. accessSync for startup permission check is appropriate.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Filesystem checks at startup only. No runtime overhead from refactoring.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Graceful in-memory fallback prevents crash on missing/unwritable volume. Both paths tested.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Single-responsibility helper. Concrete union type eliminates optional chaining. Well-documented with JSDoc.'
