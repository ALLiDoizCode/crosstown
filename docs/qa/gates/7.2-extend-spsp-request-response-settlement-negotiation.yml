gate: PASS
status_reason: "All 6 acceptance criteria met with comprehensive test coverage (27 new tests, 890 total passing). Clean implementation extending SPSP types, builders, and parsers with settlement fields. Full backward compatibility preserved, NIP-44 encryption verified through round-trip tests."

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All settlement data NIP-44 encrypted. Round-trip tests verify no plaintext leakage. Defensive input validation on all new parser fields."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "O(n) validation over small chain sets (typically 1-5). No blocking operations or additional network calls."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Proper error handling with InvalidEventError. Backward compat ensures existing events never break. All optional fields default to undefined when absent."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Follows established patterns from Story 7.1 exactly. JSDoc on all public APIs. SpspRequestSettlementInfo provides clean builder parameter type. Self-documenting code."
