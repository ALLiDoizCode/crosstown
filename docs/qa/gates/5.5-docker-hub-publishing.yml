status_reason: "All 8 ACs met. Clean GitHub Actions workflow with correct tag logic for all 3 trigger scenarios (verified including edge cases), multi-arch build, Trivy vulnerability scan, SBOM generation, and updated README. 771 tests passing across 32 test files, no regressions. Three non-blocking findings documented for future improvement."

top_issues:
  - id: "CI-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "SBOM generation and upload steps are skipped when Trivy scan fails (exit-code 1 halts the job before Steps 8-9)"
    suggested_action: "Add `if: always()` to SBOM generation and upload steps"
    suggested_owner: dev
  - id: "CI-002"
    severity: low
    finding: "Trivy scans only the amd64 variant of the multi-arch manifest; arm64 is not scanned"
    suggested_action: "Known limitation of multi-arch CI pipelines — acceptable at current maturity level"
    suggested_owner: dev
  - id: "CI-003"
    severity: low
    finding: "Tag extraction pattern `bls-v(.*)` is permissive; would match non-semver strings"
    suggested_action: "Consider stricter pattern `bls-v(\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+)` for semver enforcement"

  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Credentials via GitHub secrets only, least-privilege permissions (contents: read), Trivy scan blocks CRITICAL/HIGH CVEs. Post-push scan is a known limitation."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "GHA build cache (type=gha,mode=max) configured, concurrency group cancels redundant builds"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Concurrency prevents race conditions, exit-code 1 on Trivy ensures workflow fails on vulnerable images"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Well-commented workflow with tag-mapping documentation in header, clear 8-step separation, README accurately documents available tags"
