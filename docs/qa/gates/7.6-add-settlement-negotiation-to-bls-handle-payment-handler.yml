  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Settlement negotiation uses existing NIP-44 encrypted channel. Channel client calls are local-only (connector admin API).'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Configurable polling timeout/interval prevents indefinite blocking. Test suite uses short intervals for speed.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clear error handling contract: null for graceful degradation, throw for errors. Peer registration is non-fatal.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Shared function eliminates code duplication between SPSP paths. Well-documented interfaces and error semantics.'
