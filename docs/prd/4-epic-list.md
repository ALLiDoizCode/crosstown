# 4. Epic List

| Epic | Title | Goal |
|------|-------|------|
| 1 | Foundation & Peer Discovery | Establish project infrastructure and deliver core peer discovery from NIP-02 follow lists |
| 2 | SPSP Over Nostr | Enable SPSP parameter exchange via Nostr events (static and dynamic) |
| 3 | Social Trust Engine | Compute trust scores from social graph data for credit limit derivation |
| 4 | ILP-Gated Relay | Reference implementation of pay-to-write Nostr relay with ILP integration |
| 5 | Standalone BLS Docker Image | Publishable BLS container for agent-runtime integration with standard contract |
| 6 | Decentralized Peer Discovery | Replace ad-hoc bootstrap with layered peer discovery combining genesis peers, ArDrive registry, and NIP-02 social graph |
| 7 | SPSP Settlement Negotiation | Extend SPSP (kind:23194/23195) to negotiate settlement chains and open payment channels via connector Admin API; BLS handles negotiation policy, connector executes on-chain operations; FULFILL = channel is live |
| 8 | Nostr Network Bootstrap | Complete bootstrap flow: relay discovery → 0-amount ILP SPSP → paid announcements → cross-peer discovery; all channel operations via connector Admin API |
