# 7. Next Steps

## 7.1 Architect Prompt

> You are the Architect for the Agent Society Protocol project. Review the PRD at `docs/prd.md` and create the technical architecture document. Key considerations:
> - Monorepo structure for `@agent-society/core`, `@agent-society/relay`, `@agent-society/examples`
> - Integration patterns with agent-runtime (Admin API, BLS)
> - nostr-tools as the Nostr library
> - TOON encoding for ILP packet payloads
> - NIP-44 encryption for dynamic SPSP handshakes
>
> Begin architecture creation mode and produce the architecture document.
