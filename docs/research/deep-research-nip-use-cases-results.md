**Research Date:** 2026-02-09
**Methodology:** Full NIP specification analysis against the Signal Test (Primitive Fit, Implementation Distance, Economic Model, Differentiation, Composability)

---

## Executive Summary

### Top 5 NIP-Based Use Cases (Ranked by Signal Score)

| Rank | Use Case | NIPs Involved | Components Reused | Estimated Epics |
|------|----------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **1** | **Paid Computation Marketplace (Agent DVMs)** | NIP-90, NIP-89 | BLS per-kind pricing, TOON encoding, ILP PREPARE/FULFILL, connector routing | 1 epic |
| **2** | **ILP Zaps for Reputation & Social Routing** | NIP-57 (adapted) | SocialTrustManager, payment channels, kind:10032, connector route priority | 1.5 epics |
| **3** | **Agent Capability Taxonomy & Quality Ratings** | NIP-32, NIP-90 | kind:0 profiles, DVM results (kind:6xxx), SocialTrustManager | 0.5 epic |
| **4** | **Verifiable Agent Credentials** | NIP-58 | Connector settlement history, SocialTrustManager, Admin API channel stats | 1 epic |
| **5** | **Payment-Gated Agent Swarms** | NIP-29, NIP-51 | Payment channels, ILP address hierarchy, TOON-encoded group events | 2 epics |

**Key Finding:** NIP-90 (Data Vending Machines) is the missing skills registry primitive. It provides the exact request/response/payment pattern needed for agent-to-agent paid computation, with an existing ecosystem (DVMDash, Vendata, nostrdvm framework) that validates the pattern. Combined with ILP micropayments instead of Lightning, this creates a differentiated multi-chain paid computation marketplace that doesn't exist anywhere else.

## Detailed Analysis: NIPs That Pass the Signal Test

---

### 1. NIP-90 (Data Vending Machines) + NIP-89 (Service Discovery) — The Missing Skills Registry

**Signal Score: 5/5**

#### NIP Specification Summary

NIP-90 defines a decentralized marketplace for on-demand computation:

- **Kind 5000-5999**: Job requests from customers (19 registered kinds: text extraction, translation, image generation, AI text generation, content search, etc.)
- **Kind 6000-6999**: Job results from service providers (kind = request kind + 1000)
- **Kind 7000**: Job feedback (status updates: `payment-required`, `processing`, `error`, `success`, `partial`)
- **NIP-89 kind:31990**: Service provider discovery announcements (which job kinds a provider supports)

Key protocol features:
- **`i` tag**: Input data (URL, event ID, text, or output from another job — enabling job chaining)
- **`bid` tag**: Maximum millisatoshis customer will pay
- **`amount` tag**: Actual price requested by provider (in results/feedback)
- **`encrypted` tag**: NIP-04/44 encrypted requests for private inputs
- **Job chaining**: Output of one DVM job feeds as input to another via `"job"` input type

#### Mapping to Stack

| NIP-90 Concept | Stack Component | Mapping |
|----------------|-----------------|---------|
| Job request (kind:5xxx) | BLS per-kind pricing | Add kind:5000-5999 to pricing table (e.g., kind:5050 text-gen = 500/byte) |
| Job request transmission | TOON encoding + ILP PREPARE | TOON-encode the kind:5xxx event → ILP PREPARE data field |
| Job result (kind:6xxx) | BLS response + ILP FULFILL | BLS processes request → returns kind:6xxx event as FULFILL data |
| Job feedback (kind:7000) | BLS reject with data | Map `payment-required`/`error` to ILP REJECT with status in data field |
| `bid` tag | ILP PREPARE amount | Customer's bid = ILP packet amount field |
| `amount` tag | BLS pricing response | Provider's price communicated in REJECT data (payment-required) or FULFILL data |
| NIP-89 kind:31990 | Skills registry discovery | Agent publishes kind:31990 to relay advertising supported job kinds |
| Service provider discovery | SocialPeerDiscovery | Query kind:31990 filtered by social graph (follows' providers) |
| Job chaining | Multi-hop ILP routing | Chain jobs across agents: Agent A transcribes → Agent B summarizes → Agent C translates |

#### Payment Flow

```
Customer Agent                    Service Provider Agent
     |                                    |
     |--- ILP PREPARE ------------------>|
     |    (amount=bid, data=TOON(kind:5xxx))
     |                                    |
     |    BLS receives PaymentRequest     |
     |    BLS evaluates: can I do this job?
     |                                    |
     |    Option A: Accept immediately    |
     |<-- ILP FULFILL -------------------|
     |    (data=TOON(kind:6xxx result))   |
     |    Payment settles via channel     |
     |                                    |
     |    Option B: Reject (need more $)  |
     |<-- ILP REJECT --------------------|
     |    (data=TOON(kind:7000 payment-required, amount=actual_price))
     |                                    |
     |--- ILP PREPARE (higher amount) -->|
     |<-- ILP FULFILL -------------------|
```

**Who pays whom:** Customer agent pays service provider agent via ILP micropayment. The connector earns routing fees on multi-hop paths. Payment amount = DVM job price.

#### Implementation Sketch

**Files changed:**

1. **crosstown: BLS pricing table** — Add kind:5000-5999, 6000-6999, 7000 to `kindPricing` map
2. **crosstown: DVM handler** — New module that processes incoming DVM job requests, dispatches to local capability handlers, returns results
3. **crosstown: NIP-89 announcer** — Publish kind:31990 events advertising supported job kinds on startup
4. **crosstown: SocialPeerDiscovery** — Extend to query kind:31990 events for service discovery (in addition to kind:10032)
5. **agent-runtime: TOON encoding** — No changes needed (TOON already encodes any Nostr event)
6. **agent-runtime: PacketHandler** — No changes needed (already forwards to BLS, already uses SHA256 fulfillment)

**New event kinds needed:**
- None custom — uses standard NIP-90 kinds (5000-5999, 6000-6999, 7000) and NIP-89 kind:31990
- The existing kind:23194/23195 SPSP negotiation remains separate (settlement setup vs. job execution are different concerns)

#### Composability Map

NIP-90 enables:
- **Skills registry** (use case 5.3 in original doc) — NIP-89 announcements ARE the registry
- **Collaborative research swarms** (5.2) — Job chaining across multiple agents
- **Evolutionary skill development** (4.2) — kind:7000 feedback + NIP-32 labels for quality ratings
- **Knowledge arbitrage** (5.1) — Agents as DVM service providers with dynamic pricing
- **Skill composability marketplace** (5.3) — Chain translate → legal-contract → format via job chaining
- **Paid attention markets** (3.3) — DVM requests as paid promotional content processing

#### Risk/Gap Analysis

- **Gap: NIP-90 references NIP-04 for encryption, which is deprecated.** The spec should use NIP-44 (which we already implement). Our implementation should use NIP-44 from the start.
- **Gap: NIP-90 `amount` tag uses millisatoshis.** We need to define our own denomination (ILP asset code + scale). Can use the `amount` tag with our own format or add an `ilp-amount` tag.
- **Gap: NIP-90 payment-before-results relies on a second request.** In ILP, we can model this as: first PREPARE rejected with `payment-required` status in data, second PREPARE with higher amount accepted.
- **Risk: DVM ecosystem assumes Lightning payments.** Our ILP adaptation must be clearly documented. We should propose a formal NIP extension for ILP-backed DVMs.
- **Assumption: TOON encoding can handle DVM tag structures.** This should work since TOON encodes arbitrary Nostr events, but needs validation with complex `i` tag arrays.

---

### 2. NIP-57 (Lightning Zaps) → ILP Zaps for Reputation

**Signal Score: 5/5**

#### NIP Specification Summary

NIP-57 defines public, verifiable proof-of-payment events tied to specific Nostr events or profiles:

- **Kind 9734**: Zap request (signed by sender, sent to recipient's payment provider)
- **Kind 9735**: Zap receipt (signed by payment provider, published to relays)

Key structural elements:
- `p` tag: recipient pubkey
- `e`/`a` tags: event being zapped
- `bolt11` tag: Lightning invoice (Lightning-specific)
- `description` tag: embedded original zap request in receipt (provides cryptographic binding)
- `amount` tag: payment amount in millisatoshis
- `P` tag: sender pubkey (uppercase P in receipt)
- `zap` tag: multi-recipient payment splits with weights
- Anonymous zaps via throwaway keys

**Critical insight from spec analysis:** The Nostr event layer (kinds 9734/9735, tag structures, relay publication) is fundamentally payment-system-agnostic. The Lightning-specific components are the LNURL discovery, BOLT11 invoices, and the LNURL provider bridge. These are cleanly separable.

#### Mapping to Stack

| NIP-57 Component | Lightning-Specific? | ILP Replacement |
|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Kind 9734 structure | No | Keep as-is (or use new kind, e.g., kind:9736) |
| Kind 9735 structure | No | Keep as-is (or use new kind, e.g., kind:9737) |
| LNURL discovery | Yes | kind:10032 ILP Peer Info (already implemented) |
| BOLT11 invoice | Yes | ILP payment pointer + STREAM shared secret |
| `bolt11` tag | Yes | `ilp-receipt` tag with STREAM receipt data |
| `preimage` tag | Yes | `fulfillment` tag with SHA256(data) proof |
| LNURL provider (bridge) | Yes | Agent-runtime + connector (already built) |
| `amount` in millisats | Yes | ILP amount with asset code/scale |
| `description` hash binding | Yes (BOLT11 specific) | SHA256(zap-request-json) stored in receipt |
| Multi-recipient `zap` tag | No | Keep as-is; route proportional ILP payments |
| Anonymous zaps | No | Keep as-is; throwaway Nostr keys |

#### Payment Flow: ILP Zap

```
Zapper Agent                        Zappee Agent
     |                                    |
     | 1. Create kind:9734 ILP zap request |
     |    (p=recipient, e=target event,    |
     |     amount=ILP amount, relays=[...]) |
     |                                    |
     | 2. ILP PREPARE ------------------>|
     |    (amount=zap amount,              |
     |     data=TOON(kind:9734 request))   |
     |                                    |
     |    BLS receives, validates zap req  |
     |    BLS accepts payment              |
     |                                    |
     |<-- ILP FULFILL -------------------|
     |    (fulfillment=SHA256(data))       |
     |                                    |
     | 3. Zappee's BLS creates kind:9735  |
     |    receipt, publishes to relays     |
     |    specified in zap request         |
     |                                    |
     | 4. SocialTrustManager observes     |
     |    kind:9735 receipts on relay      |
     |    → updates trust scores           |
```

**Who pays whom:** Zapper pays zappee. The zap amount is the ILP PREPARE amount. The receipt (kind:9735) is public proof that payment occurred.

#### Trust Score Formula

```
trustScore(agent) =
    w1 * socialDistance(followGraph, self, agent) +    // BFS on kind:3 (already implemented)
    w2 * mutualFollowers(self, agent) +                 // Already in SocialTrustManager
    w3 * zapVolumeReceived(agent, window=30d) +         // NEW: sum of ILP zap amounts received
    w4 * zapDiversity(agent) +                          // NEW: unique zappers (Sybil resistance)
    w5 * settlementReliability(agent) +                 // NEW: % successful channel settlements
    w6 * channelDepositsTotal(agent)                    // NEW: total deposits across channels
```

**How this feeds into route priority:** During peer registration (`POST /admin/peers`), include a `priority` field derived from the trust score. The connector's route selection uses priority as a tiebreaker when multiple routes match the same prefix.

#### Implementation Sketch

**Files changed (crosstown):**

1. **SocialTrustManager** — Wire up the TODO for zap-based reputation. Add `zapVolumeReceived()` and `zapDiversity()` methods that query kind:9735 receipts from relay.
2. **BLS zap handler** — New module that recognizes kind:9734 requests in ILP PREPARE data, validates structure, accepts payment, publishes kind:9735 receipt to specified relays.
3. **SocialPeerDiscovery** — When registering peers, compute trust score including zap history, pass as priority to connector Admin API.

**Files changed (agent-runtime):**

4. **Connector Admin API** — Add optional `priority` field to `POST /admin/peers` for trust-weighted route registration (if not already present).

**New event kinds:**
- kind:9736 (ILP Zap Request) — OR reuse kind:9734 with an `ilp` tag to distinguish from Lightning zaps
- kind:9737 (ILP Zap Receipt) — OR reuse kind:9735 with `ilp-receipt` tag instead of `bolt11` tag

#### Composability Map

ILP Zaps enable:
- **Social routing** (7.1) — Trust scores from zap history feed into route priority
- **Social credit scoring** (7.2) — Zap volume + settlement history = decentralized credit score
- **Attention markets** (3.3) — Zap as payment for attention; agents zap high-influence agents to promote content
- **Living agent profiles** (1.1) — Zap history visible on kind:0 profiles
- **Quality feedback loops** — Zap DVM results to signal quality (composes with NIP-32 labels)

#### Risk/Gap Analysis

- **Gap: NIP-57's trust model is weak ("not a proof of payment").** ILP Zaps are strictly better: the ILP FULFILL with SHA256(data) is cryptographic proof that the exact data was delivered and accepted. The receipt can include the fulfillment as verification.
- **Gap: Need to define the ILP-specific tag format for zap receipts.** Propose: `["ilp-amount", "<amount>", "<asset-code>", "<asset-scale>"]` and `["fulfillment", "<base64-fulfillment>"]` instead of `bolt11`/`preimage`.
- **Risk: Nostr clients (Primal, Damus) won't display ILP zap receipts.** This is acceptable — agent-to-agent zaps don't need human client rendering. But if we want human visibility, we should use kind:9735 with the standard structure plus additional ILP tags.
- **Assumption: SocialTrustManager can query zap receipts efficiently.** Need to ensure relay supports `#p` tag filtering on kind:9735 events.

### 3. NIP-32 (Labeling) — Agent Capability Tags & Quality Ratings

**Signal Score: 4/5 (weak standalone economic model, strong when composed)**

#### NIP Specification Summary

NIP-32 provides a generic labeling system using kind:1985 events:

- **`L` tag**: Label namespace (e.g., `agent-skill`, `ISO-639-1`, `com.example.ontology`)
- **`l` tag**: Label value within namespace (e.g., `translation`, `code-audit`, `sentiment-analysis`)
- Target tags: `e` (events), `p` (pubkeys), `a` (addressable events), `r` (relays/URLs), `t` (topics)
- Self-reporting: `L`/`l` tags can be added to any event kind (not just kind:1985) to label the event itself

#### Mapping to Stack

**Use Case A: Agent Capability Taxonomy**

Agents self-label their kind:0 profiles with capabilities:

```json
{
  "kind": 0,
  "content": "{\"name\": \"TranslationBot\", \"about\": \"Multi-language translation agent\"}",
  "tags": [
    ["L", "agent-skill"],
    ["l", "translation", "agent-skill"],
    ["l", "ja-en", "agent-skill"],
    ["l", "es-en", "agent-skill"],
    ["L", "agent-tier"],
    ["l", "premium", "agent-tier"]
  ]
}
```

**Use Case B: Post-Payment Quality Ratings**

After receiving a DVM result (kind:6xxx), the customer agent publishes a label:

```json
{
  "kind": 1985,
  "tags": [
    ["L", "agent-quality"],
    ["l", "excellent", "agent-quality"],
    ["e", "<kind-6050-result-event-id>", "<relay>"],
    ["p", "<service-provider-pubkey>", "<relay>"]
  ],
  "content": "Translation was accurate and idiomatic. 5/5."
}
```

**Use Case C: Distrust/Warning Labels**

```json
{
  "kind": 1985,
  "tags": [
    ["L", "agent-warning"],
    ["l", "slow-settlement", "agent-warning"],
    ["p", "<unreliable-agent-pubkey>", "<relay>"]
  ]
}
```

#### Payment Flow

Labels themselves are free to publish. The economic value comes from composition:
- **DVM result labels** create a feedback loop: agents with higher quality labels get more DVM jobs → more ILP revenue
- **Capability labels** enable service discovery: agents find specialists via label queries → pay via ILP for services
- **Warning labels** reduce losses: agents avoid unreliable peers → fewer failed settlements

#### Implementation Sketch

1. **crosstown: kind:0 profile builder** — Add `L`/`l` tags for agent capabilities during bootstrap
2. **crosstown: Quality labeler** — After DVM job completion, publish kind:1985 rating label
3. **crosstown: SocialTrustManager** — Query kind:1985 labels for `agent-quality` and `agent-warning` namespaces, factor into trust score
4. **No agent-runtime changes needed**

#### Composability Map

- Composes with NIP-90 DVMs: quality labels on DVM results create reputation feedback
- Composes with NIP-58 badges: labels are lightweight signals, badges are heavyweight credentials
- Composes with NIP-57 zaps: zap + quality label = economic vote + qualitative feedback
- Enables skill taxonomy for agent capability discovery

---

### 4. NIP-58 (Badges) — Verifiable Agent Credentials

**Signal Score: 4/5 (indirect economic model, strong for trust infrastructure)**

#### NIP Specification Summary

Three-event badge lifecycle:

- **Kind 30009**: Badge Definition (addressable, published by issuer)
  - Tags: `d` (unique ID), `name`, `description`, `image`, `thumb`
- **Kind 8**: Badge Award (issued to one or more recipients via `p` tags)
  - Tags: `a` (references definition), `p` (recipient pubkeys)
- **Kind 30008**: Profile Badges (recipient curates which badges to display)
  - Tags: `d` = "profile_badges", ordered `a`+`e` pairs

#### Mapping to Stack

| Badge Concept | Agent Network Mapping |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Badge issuer | Connector operator OR automated issuer agent |
| Badge definition | Settlement reliability metric, throughput benchmark, uptime certification |
| Badge award | Auto-issued when agent crosses threshold (e.g., 1000 settled channels) |
| Badge display | Agent's kind:0 profile includes kind:30008 reference |
| Badge verification | Standard Nostr signature verification — issuer pubkey signs definition AND award |

**Example Badge Definitions:**

```json
{
  "kind": 30009,
  "tags": [
    ["d", "settlement-reliability-99"],
    ["name", "99% Settlement Reliability"],
    ["description", "Awarded to agents with >=99% successful payment channel settlements over 30 days"],
    ["image", "https://badges.agentnetwork.io/settlement-99.png", "256x256"]
  ]
}
```

```json
{
  "kind": 30009,
  "tags": [
    ["d", "high-throughput-1m"],
    ["name", "1M Packets Routed"],
    ["description", "Agent has routed over 1 million ILP packets"],
    ["image", "https://badges.agentnetwork.io/throughput-1m.png", "256x256"]
  ]
}
```

#### Payment Flow

Badges themselves are free. Economic impact:
- Agents with better badges get **higher trust scores** → **more routing traffic** → **more routing fees**
- Badge-gated services: agents can require certain badges before accepting DVM jobs from unknown peers
- **"Credit scoring without a central authority"** — badges + zap history + settlement stats = decentralized creditworthiness

#### Implementation Sketch

1. **crosstown: Badge issuer service** — Monitor connector Admin API (`GET /admin/channels`, `GET /admin/settlement/states`) for settlement metrics. Auto-publish kind:8 awards when thresholds are crossed.
2. **crosstown: Badge definitions** — Define standard badge set on bootstrap (settlement-99, throughput-1m, early-adopter, etc.)
3. **crosstown: SocialTrustManager** — Query kind:30008 profile badges for trusted issuer pubkeys, factor into trust score
4. **crosstown: Bootstrap service** — Include badge definitions in the 3-phase discovery flow

#### Composability Map

- Composes with NIP-32 labels: labels = lightweight signals, badges = heavyweight credentials
- Composes with NIP-57 zaps: zap volume + badges = multi-signal trust model
- Composes with NIP-51 lists: "trusted issuers" list curates which badge issuers are credible
- Enables: credit scoring (7.2), social routing (7.1), premium service tiers

---

### 5. NIP-29 (Groups) + NIP-51 (Lists) — Payment-Gated Agent Swarms & Social Routing

**Signal Score: 4/5 (NIP-29) / 3/5 (NIP-51 — weak economic model alone)**

#### NIP-29 Specification Summary

Relay-based groups with structured membership management:

- **Group events**: Any kind can be group-scoped by adding `h` tag
- **Kind 9021/9022**: Join/leave requests
- **Kind 9000-9009**: Admin actions (put-user, remove-user, edit-metadata, create-invite, etc.)
- **Kind 39000-39003**: Relay-signed metadata (group info, admins, members, roles)
- **Access control**: `private` (members-only read), `restricted` (members-only write), `closed` (invite-only), `hidden` (metadata hidden)
- **Timeline integrity**: `previous` tags reference recent group events to prevent out-of-context forks

#### NIP-51 Specification Summary

Curated lists with public and encrypted items:

- **Kind 10000**: Mute list (distrust signals)
- **Kind 30000**: Follow sets (categorized people groups, e.g., "trusted-routes")
- **Kind 10001**: Pinned notes
- Private items encrypted via NIP-44 in `content` field

#### Agent Swarm as Group — Payment Flow

```
Lifecycle:
1. FORM:   Orchestrator agent creates group (kind:9007)
           Sets membership requirement: min channel deposit
           Publishes kind:39000 metadata (restricted, closed)

2. JOIN:   Specialist agents send kind:9021 join requests
           Orchestrator verifies: open payment channel with min deposit?
           If yes: kind:9000 put-user
           Group ILP prefix allocated: g.swarm-<group-id>.<member-pubkey>

3. WORK:   Intra-swarm communication via TOON-encoded group events
           Each event sent as ILP PREPARE to group members
           Payment per event = sub-task compensation

4. SETTLE: Orchestrator aggregates results
           Publishes final output (kind:30023 long-form article)
           Payment channels settle
           Group dissolved (kind:9008 delete-group)
```

#### Social Routing via Lists

```
Trusted Routes List (kind:30000):
{
  "kind": 30000,
  "tags": [
    ["d", "trusted-routes"],
    ["p", "<high-reliability-peer-1>"],
    ["p", "<high-reliability-peer-2>"],
    ["p", "<low-latency-peer-3>"]
  ]
}

Mute List as Distrust Signal (kind:10000):
{
  "kind": 10000,
  "tags": [
    ["p", "<known-bad-actor>"],
    ["p", "<unreliable-settler>"]
  ]
}
```

**Routing integration:** SocialPeerDiscovery reads kind:30000 "trusted-routes" set and kind:10000 mute list → adjusts route priority during `POST /admin/peers` registration → connector prefers trusted routes for packet forwarding.

#### Implementation Sketch

**NIP-29 (2 epics):**
1. **Epic A: Group lifecycle management** — Create/join/leave groups, membership validation against channel state
2. **Epic B: Group→ILP address mapping** — Allocate ILP address prefixes per group, route intra-group traffic, TOON-encode group events

**NIP-51 (0.5 epic, can be done within social routing epic):**
1. Publish kind:30000 "trusted-routes" from SocialTrustManager
2. Subscribe to mute lists (kind:10000) as negative trust signals
3. Wire into route priority during peer registration

## Social Fabric Layer: NIPs That Enable Agent Social Behavior

The use cases above (DVMs, zaps, labels, badges, swarms) assume a functioning social layer underneath. The following NIPs provide the identity, communication, content, and moderation primitives that make agents first-class participants in the Nostr social network — visible to both other agents and human users.

### Already Implemented

| NIP | Status | Event Kinds | Implementation |
|-----|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **NIP-01** (Basic Protocol) | `mandatory` | 0 (metadata), 1 (text note) + kind ranges | Agent-society relay: full read/write, filter matching, event verification |
| **NIP-02** (Follow Lists) | `final` | 3 (follow list, replaceable) | SocialPeerDiscovery: kind:3 → query kind:10032 → SPSP handshake → register peer |
| **NIP-44** (Versioned Encryption) | `draft` | N/A (encryption primitive) | SPSP negotiation encryption (kind:23194/23195) |

---

### Social Identity

#### NIP-05 — DNS-Based Verification (`final`)

Maps Nostr pubkeys to human-readable identifiers (`agent-alpha@agents.example.com`). The domain hosts `/.well-known/nostr.json` which clients fetch to verify the mapping.

**Kind:0 with NIP-05 field:**
```json
{
  "kind": 0,
  "content": "{\"name\":\"agent-alpha\",\"about\":\"ILP settlement agent\",\"nip05\":\"agent-alpha@agents.example.com\"}"
}
```

**DNS endpoint response (`/.well-known/nostr.json?name=agent-alpha`):**
```json
{
  "names": {
    "agent-alpha": "<hex-pubkey>",
    "agent-beta": "<hex-pubkey>"
  },
  "relays": {
    "<hex-pubkey>": ["wss://relay1.example.com"]
  }
}
```

**Agent relevance:**
- Organizational namespacing: all agents under one domain (`alpha@agents.acme.com`, `beta@agents.acme.com`)
- Human-readable discovery without knowing hex pubkeys
- The `relays` field in the response doubles as relay discovery
- Interoperable with human Nostr clients (Primal, Damus, Amethyst)
- The `.well-known/nostr.json` endpoint becomes a lightweight agent catalog

#### NIP-65 — Relay List Metadata (`draft`)

Agents advertise their preferred relays for reading and writing via kind:10002 (replaceable).

```json
{
  "kind": 10002,
  "tags": [
    ["r", "wss://primary-relay.example.com"],
    ["r", "wss://write-relay.example.com", "write"],
    ["r", "wss://read-relay.example.com", "read"]
  ]
}
```

**Client behavior:** To find agent X's events → query X's write relays. To send events mentioning X → publish to X's read relays.

**Agent relevance:**
- Essential for multi-relay deployments (agents declare where to find their kind:10032, kind:31990 events)
- Complements kind:10032 (ILP Peer Info): NIP-65 says which relays to query; kind:10032 has the BTP endpoint
- Enables relay migration without breaking peering relationships
- Load balancing across relays

---

### Social Communication

#### NIP-17 — Private Direct Messages (`draft`)

Replaces deprecated NIP-04 with a three-layer encryption scheme for metadata-private messaging.

**Architecture:** Message (kind:14 unsigned rumor) → encrypted in kind:13 seal (signed by sender) → encrypted in kind:1059 gift wrap (signed by random one-time key).

**Kind:14 chat message (inner rumor, unsigned):**
```json
{
  "kind": 14,
  "pubkey": "<sender>",
  "tags": [
    ["p", "<recipient-1>", "wss://relay.example.com"],
    ["e", "<parent-message-id>", "", "reply"],
    ["subject", "Settlement negotiation"]
  ],
  "content": "I can provide Base L2 settlement at 0.1% fee."
}
```

**Kind:10050 DM relay preference (replaceable):**
```json
{
  "kind": 10050,
  "tags": [
    ["relay", "wss://dm-relay.example.com"]
  ]
}
```

**Agent relevance:**
- Private service negotiation (pricing, SLAs, terms) before ILP peering
- Kind:15 file messages for encrypted delivery of computation results
- Gift-wrap scheme hides which agents are communicating from relay operators
- Kind:10050 separates DM relays from public service announcement relays
- Group DMs (up to ~100 participants) for multi-agent coordination

#### NIP-09 — Event Deletion (`draft`)

Agents request deletion of their own events via kind:5 referencing target events.

```json
{
  "kind": 5,
  "tags": [
    ["e", "<event-id-to-delete>"],
    ["a", "30023:<pubkey>:<d-tag>"],
    ["k", "1"],
    ["k", "30023"]
  ],
  "content": "Outdated service listing."
}
```

**Agent relevance:** Retract stale service offers, correct malformed kind:10032 publications, clean up expired pricing.

#### NIP-10 — Text Notes and Threads (`draft`)

Defines how kind:1 text notes create threaded conversations via marked `e` tags (`root`, `reply`).

```json
{
  "kind": 1,
  "tags": [
    ["e", "<root-event-id>", "wss://relay.example.com", "root", "<root-author>"],
    ["e", "<parent-event-id>", "wss://relay.example.com", "reply", "<parent-author>"],
    ["p", "<root-author>"],
    ["p", "<parent-author>"]
  ],
  "content": "What settlement latency should we target?"
}
```

**Agent relevance:** Public multi-turn discussions, task decomposition threads, audit trails of agent interactions.

#### NIP-18 — Reposts (`draft`)

Kind:6 for reposting kind:1 notes; kind:16 for generic reposts of any other kind.

```json
{
  "kind": 16,
  "tags": [
    ["e", "<original-event-id>", "wss://relay.example.com"],
    ["p", "<original-author>"],
    ["k", "30023"]
  ],
  "content": "<optional: full JSON of reposted event>"
}
```

**Agent relevance:** Service recommendations (repost = endorsement), signal amplification across relay clusters, reputation signal for SocialTrustManager.

#### NIP-25 — Reactions (`draft`)

Kind:7 reactions (`"+"` like, `"-"` dislike, or emoji) targeting events.

```json
{
  "kind": 7,
  "content": "+",
  "tags": [
    ["e", "<target-event-id>", "wss://relay.example.com"],
    ["p", "<target-author>"],
    ["k", "1"]
  ]
}
```

**Agent relevance:**
- Simplest post-payment quality signal: after ILP service delivery, publish `"+"` reaction
- Aggregated like/dislike ratio as trust input for SocialTrustManager
- Custom emoji reactions for structured feedback (`:fast-settlement:`, `:accurate:`)
- Lightweight alternative to NIP-32 labels for quick feedback

#### NIP-56 — Reporting (`draft`)

Kind:1984 reports flag problematic agents with typed categories.

```json
{
  "kind": 1984,
  "tags": [
    ["p", "<reported-agent-pubkey>", "spam"],
    ["e", "<offending-event-id>", "malware"]
  ],
  "content": "Agent sends unsolicited service advertisements."
}
```

**Report types:** `nudity`, `malware`, `profanity`, `illegal`, `spam`, `impersonation`, `other`

**Agent relevance:**
- Flag agents delivering malware, failing settlement, or impersonating identities
- Social-graph-weighted moderation: reports from trusted peers (within BFS distance) carry more weight
- Input to SocialTrustManager: N+ spam reports from agents within social distance 3 → reduce trust score
- `impersonation` type critical when NIP-05 identifiers convey organizational trust

---

### Social Content

#### NIP-23 — Long-form Content (`draft`)

Addressable events (kind:30023) for articles with Markdown content, updateable via stable `d` tag.

```json
{
  "kind": 30023,
  "tags": [
    ["d", "settlement-analysis-q4-2025"],
    ["title", "Settlement Performance Analysis: Q4 2025"],
    ["summary", "Cross-chain settlement latency across Base L2, XRPL, and Aptos."],
    ["image", "https://example.com/chart.png"],
    ["published_at", "1672531200"],
    ["t", "settlement"],
    ["t", "ilp"]
  ],
  "content": "# Settlement Performance Analysis\n\nThis report examines..."
}
```

**Agent relevance:**
- Already priced in BLS (kind:30023 = 100/byte, "expensive")
- Paid content marketplace: gate long-form analysis behind ILP micropayments
- Updateable service documentation via stable `d` tag references
- Topic discovery via `t` tags

#### NIP-72 — Moderated Communities (`draft`)

Reddit-style communities (kind:34550) with moderator approval (kind:4550) and threaded posts (kind:1111).

```json
{
  "kind": 34550,
  "tags": [
    ["d", "ilp-settlement-agents"],
    ["name", "ILP Settlement Agents"],
    ["description", "Community for agents providing cross-chain settlement services."],
    ["p", "<moderator-agent-1>", "", "moderator"],
    ["p", "<moderator-agent-2>", "", "moderator"],
    ["relay", "wss://community-relay.example.com", "author"]
  ]
}
```

**Agent relevance:**
- Curated service marketplaces: moderator agents approve vetted service offers
- Capability-based communities (translation agents, data analysis agents)
- Automated moderation: moderator agents approve based on NIP-05 identity, trust score, report history
- Community-scoped pricing via BLS per-kind extensions

#### NIP-36 — Sensitive Content / Content Warning (`draft`)

Tag-based content warning on any event kind.

```json
["content-warning", "Contains security vulnerability details"]
```

**Agent relevance:** Flag expensive operations, security-sensitive outputs, or unverified/experimental results.

## Anti-Patterns Section: NIPs That Fail the Signal Test

### NIP-15 (Nostr Marketplace) — NOISE

**Why it looks appealing:** Structured product listings with prices could model agent capabilities as "products."

**Why it fails:**
- **Primitive Fit**: WEAK — NIP-15 uses NIP-04 (deprecated/unrecommended) for checkout. The payment flow (human e-commerce with order → invoice → payment) doesn't map to ILP PREPARE/FULFILL. The stall/product model is designed for physical goods with shipping zones.
- **Implementation Distance**: 2+ epics with significant adaptation
- **Differentiation**: FAIL — NIP-90 DVMs are a strictly better fit for machine-to-machine paid computation. NIP-15 adds human-readable product listings but duplicates DVM functionality for agent interactions.
- **Economic Model**: Exists but awkward — the order/invoice/payment cycle adds unnecessary roundtrips when ILP provides single-packet payment.

**Verdict:** Use NIP-90 for agent-to-agent computation marketplace. Use NIP-99 only if you need human-discoverable agent service listings (e.g., on Amethyst/Coracle) — but this is a secondary concern, not foundational.

### NIP-99 (Classified Listings) — WEAK SIGNAL (only for human discovery)

**Why it's better than NIP-15:** Simpler structure (kind:30402), supported by major clients (Amethyst, Coracle, Shopstr), has `price` tag with currency support.

**Why it doesn't pass:** It's useful for making agent services discoverable to humans (e.g., listing "Translation Agent - $0.001/word" on ostrich.work) but adds nothing for agent-to-agent discovery that NIP-89 kind:31990 doesn't already provide.

**Conditional use:** If human discoverability is a priority in a future epic, publish agent capabilities as BOTH NIP-89 kind:31990 (for agent discovery) AND NIP-99 kind:30402 (for human discovery). This costs one additional Nostr event per capability.

### NIP-47 (Nostr Wallet Connect) — NOISE

**Why it fails:**
- **Kind conflict:** NIP-47 uses kinds 23194 and 23195 — the EXACT same kinds we already use for SPSP negotiation. Adopting NIP-47 would require migrating our SPSP events to different kinds.
- **Lightning-specific:** NWC operations (`pay_invoice`, `make_invoice`, `lookup_invoice`) are Lightning concepts. Adapting to ILP would require redefining every operation.
- **Redundancy:** Our connector Admin API already provides richer payment channel management (`POST /admin/channels`, deposit, close, etc.) than NWC's operation set.
- **Design reference only:** The project already uses NIP-47 as "design reference" — the encrypted request/response pattern was adopted for kind:23194/23195. No further value in deeper integration.

### NIP-53 (Live Activities) — DEFERRED SIGNAL

**Why it's interesting:** kind:30311 live activity events + STREAM micropayment gating could model real-time data stream subscriptions. An agent could broadcast market data as a live activity, with subscribers paying per-second via STREAM.

**Why it's deferred:**
- **Implementation Distance**: ~1.5 epics
- **Economic Model**: Clear (publisher/subscriber) but requires STREAM integration which isn't fully wired in crosstown
- **Priority**: This is a specific use case (data streaming), not foundational infrastructure. Build DVMs and zaps first; streaming subscriptions become a DVM variant later.

### NIP-46 (Remote Signing) — DEFERRED SIGNAL

**Why it's interesting:** For multi-agent deployments, a "bunker" agent could hold master Nostr keys and sign on behalf of sub-agents (kind:24133 events). This solves key duplication across containers.

**Why it's deferred:**
- **No economic model** — Key management is infrastructure, not revenue-generating
- **Implementation Distance**: ~1 epic, but only needed at scale (10+ agent containers)
- **Priority**: Current deployment model (one keypair per agent container) works for initial scale. Revisit when multi-agent orchestration becomes a bottleneck.

### NIP-78 (Application-specific Data) — NOISE

**Why it fails:**
- **Low differentiation** — Storing agent state on relays (kind:30078) competes with local persistence and doesn't require ILP
- **No economic model**
- **Relay storage is not designed for high-frequency state updates** — Agent state changes every packet; relay storage is for infrequent updates

### NIP-85 (Trusted Assertions) — PREMATURE SIGNAL

**Why it's interesting:** kind:30382-30384 assertions could formalize arbiter agents that attest to task completion, enabling conditional ILP payments.

**Why it's premature:**
- **Draft/optional status** — Spec may change
- **Minimal client support** — No known implementations in production
- **Implementation Distance**: ~2 epics (need assertion framework + conditional payment logic)
- **Priority**: The arbiter pattern can be prototyped using NIP-32 labels + NIP-58 badges first. If the pattern proves valuable, migrate to NIP-85 when the spec stabilizes.

### NIP-69 (P2P Order Events) — NOISE

**Why it fails:**
- **Overlap with NIP-90:** The offer/take model (kind:38383) for service agreements duplicates DVM request/result flows
- **Draft/optional status**
- **Designed for human trades** (Bitcoin P2P), not machine-speed agent interactions
- **No ecosystem adoption** for agent use cases

The social fabric (Phase 0) should be built first — NIP-05 identity and NIP-65 relay discovery are prerequisites for agents to find each other, while NIP-25 reactions and NIP-56 reports provide the simplest trust signals before the heavier NIP-57 zap infrastructure is built. NIP-90 then provides the "skills" that all other NIPs rate, reward, and organize.

### Proposed Formal NIPs

The following should be proposed as formal NIPs extending the existing Interledger-on-Nostr event family:

1. **NIP-ILP-01: ILP Peer Info (kind:10032)** — Already implemented, formalize the spec
2. **NIP-ILP-02: ILP Settlement Negotiation (kind:23194/23195)** — Already implemented, formalize
3. **NIP-ILP-03: ILP Zap Receipts** — New, adapting NIP-57 for ILP payments
4. **NIP-ILP-04: ILP-Backed DVMs** — Extension of NIP-90 specifying ILP payment flows instead of Lightning
