# Documentation Cleanup - February 20, 2026

## Summary

Crosstown documentation has been refocused to reflect the actual implemented scope: **an ILP-gated Nostr relay protocol library**. Out-of-scope features have been archived for future reference.

## What Changed

### ✅ Implementation Status (Epics 1-10)
All core functionality is **COMPLETE** and published to npm at v1.1.1:
- Foundation & peer discovery (NIP-02, kind:10032)
- SPSP over Nostr (kinds 23194/23195)
- Social trust engine
- ILP-gated relay reference implementation
- Standalone BLS Docker image
- Layered peer discovery (genesis, ArDrive, social)
- Settlement negotiation (multi-chain)
- Network bootstrap service
- npm package publishing (3 packages)
- Embedded connector integration

### 📦 Published Packages
- `@crosstown/core@1.1.1`
- `@crosstown/bls@1.1.1`
- `@crosstown/relay@1.1.1`

### 📋 Updated PRD

**Version:** 3.0 (from 2.0)

**Key Changes:**
- Removed references to unimplemented Epics 11-17
- Updated package count from 6 to 4
- Removed agent runtime functional requirements (FR31-36)
- Removed agent runtime NFR (NFR13)

### 📊 Final Documentation Counts

| Category | Active | Archived |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **Epics** | 10 | 7 |
| **Stories** | 60 | 5 |
| **Research** | 1 | 14 |

## Rationale

After successfully implementing the core ILP-gated relay functionality (Epics 1-10), the project refocused on its original mission rather than expanding into agent runtimes, computation marketplaces, and git collaboration.

The current implementation provides a **production-ready protocol library** for:
- Discovering ILP peers via Nostr
- Exchanging SPSP parameters over Nostr
- Building ILP-gated Nostr relays
- Bootstrapping payment networks

## Future Use of Archived Content

The archived documentation may be valuable for:
- Future projects building on Crosstown's foundation
- Reference implementations of advanced Nostr+ILP patterns
- Understanding potential expansion paths
- NIP proposal inspiration

Nothing was deleted—all work is preserved in `docs/archive/` with a comprehensive README.
