### Infrastructure Stack
1. **Crosstown Full Node** (`crosstown:optimized` - 864 MB)
   - ✅ BLS (Business Logic Server) - `http://localhost:3100`
   - ✅ Nostr Relay (WebSocket) - `ws://localhost:7100`
   - ✅ Bootstrap Service - discovering peers
   - ✅ SPSP Server - payment pointer resolution
   - ✅ Event storage - in-memory TOON format

2. **Agent-Runtime Connector** (`agent-runtime:patched` with Express 4.x)
   - ✅ ILP Packet Routing - BTP Server on port 3000
   - ✅ Admin API - `http://localhost:8081` for peer/route management
   - ✅ Health API - `http://localhost:8080/health`
   - ✅ Local Delivery - forwarding packets to Crosstown BLS
   - ✅ Peer Management - dynamic peer registration
   - ✅ Route Management - prefix-based routing

3. **Anvil (Local Ethereum)** - `http://localhost:8545`
   - ✅ Local blockchain running
   - ✅ 10 test accounts with 10,000 ETH each
   - ✅ Chain ID: 31337
   - ✅ Detected by agent-runtime

### Tested Functionality

#### 1. Health Checks ✅
```bash
curl http://localhost:3100/health  # Crosstown
curl http://localhost:8080/health  # Agent-Runtime
```

**Result:** Both services healthy, all components operational

#### 2. Peer Registration ✅
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/admin/peers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "test-peer-1",
    "url": "ws://test-peer:3000",
    "authToken": "test-token-123"
  }'
```

**Result:** Peer registered successfully via admin API

#### 3. Route Configuration ✅
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/admin/routes \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prefix": "g.test",
    "nextHop": "test-peer-1"
  }'
```

**Result:** Route added successfully, routing table updated

#### 4. Nostr Relay WebSocket ✅
```bash
nc -z localhost 7100  # Port check
```

**Result:** WebSocket listener active on port 7100

#### 5. Local Delivery Integration ✅
- Agent-runtime configured to forward packets to `http://crosstown:3100`
- Crosstown BLS ready to receive ILP packets
- `/handle-packet` endpoint available for packet processing

## ⚠️ Payment Channels - Requires Additional Setup

### Current Status
Payment channel infrastructure is **not enabled** because:

```
{
  "error": "Service Unavailable",
  "message": "Settlement infrastructure not enabled"
}
```

### Root Cause
Payment channels require deployed smart contracts on the blockchain. Specifically:

1. **Payment Channel Registry Contract** - Not deployed to Anvil
2. **Registry Address** - Missing `BASE_REGISTRY_ADDRESS` environment variable
3. **Token Contracts** - Optional, for multi-token support

### What's Configured ✅
- ✅ Anvil blockchain running on http://anvil:8545
- ✅ BASE blockchain detected (Chain ID: 31337)
- ✅ Private key configured (Anvil test account #0)
- ✅ `settlementInfra.enabled: true` in config
- ✅ `BASE_ENABLED=true` environment variable

### What's Missing ❌
- ❌ Payment channel registry contract deployed
- ❌ `BASE_REGISTRY_ADDRESS` environment variable
- ❌ Payment channel factory contracts
- ❌ Token network contracts (optional)

---

## 📋 To Enable Full Payment Channel Testing

### Option 1: Deploy Contracts to Anvil (Recommended)

#### Step 1: Deploy Payment Channel Contracts
```bash
# Clone agent-runtime contracts repository
git clone <agent-runtime-contracts-repo> ../agent-runtime-contracts

# Deploy to Anvil
cd ../agent-runtime-contracts
forge install
PRIVATE_KEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 \
  forge script script/Deploy.s.sol:Deploy \
  --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 \
  --broadcast

# Note the deployed registry address
export REGISTRY_ADDRESS=<deployed-address>
```

#### Step 2: Update docker-compose-with-anvil.yml
```yaml
agent-runtime:
  environment:
    BASE_REGISTRY_ADDRESS: "<deployed-registry-address>"
```

#### Step 3: Restart Services
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-with-anvil.yml restart agent-runtime
```

#### Step 4: Verify Payment Channels Enabled
```bash
curl http://localhost:8081/admin/channels
# Should return: {"channels": []} instead of error
```

### Option 2: Use Existing Testnet (Alternative)

Instead of local Anvil, connect to Base Sepolia testnet:

```yaml
agent-runtime:
  environment:
    BASE_RPC_URL: https://sepolia.base.org
    BASE_CHAIN_ID: "84532"
    BASE_REGISTRY_ADDRESS: "<testnet-registry-address>"
    BASE_PRIVATE_KEY: "<your-testnet-private-key>"
```

## 🧪 Payment Channel Testing Workflow

Once contracts are deployed, you can test the full payment channel lifecycle:

### 1. Create Payment Channel
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/admin/channels \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "peerId": "test-peer-1",
    "initialDeposit": "1000000"
  }'
```

### 2. Send ILP Packets
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/admin/ilp/send \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "destination": "g.test.receiver.address",
    "sourceAmount": "100",
    "data": "<base64-encoded-packet-data>"
  }'
```

### 3. Monitor Channel Balance
```bash
curl http://localhost:8081/admin/balances/test-peer-1
```

**Expected:** Balance should decrease as packets are sent

### 4. Query Payment Channel Claims
```bash
CHANNEL_ID=<channel-id-from-create-response>
curl http://localhost:8081/admin/channels/$CHANNEL_ID/claims
```

**Expected:** List of claims for packets sent through the channel

### 5. Trigger Settlement
```bash
# Balance tracking will automatically trigger settlement
# when threshold is reached, or manually:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/admin/settlement/trigger \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "peerId": "test-peer-1"
  }'
```

### 6. Verify On-Chain Settlement
```bash
# Check channel contract state on Anvil
cast call $CHANNEL_ADDRESS "getState()"  \
  --rpc-url http://localhost:8545

# Check wallet balance change
cast balance 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266 \
  --rpc-url http://localhost:8545
```

**Expected:** Settlement updates on-chain state, wallet balances change

## 📊 Current Test Results

### ✅ Working
- Service health checks
- Peer management (register, list, remove)
- Route configuration
- ILP packet routing infrastructure
- Local delivery to Crosstown BLS
- Nostr relay event storage
- Bootstrap peer discovery
- Admin API endpoints

### ⏳ Requires Contracts
- Payment channel creation
- Channel balance tracking
- Payment claims
- On-chain settlement
- Wallet balance updates

### 🔧 Issues Fixed During Deployment
1. **Missing Express dependency** → Patched with Express 4.x
2. **Missing config.yaml** → Created configuration file
3. **Wrong health check port** → Fixed AGENT_RUNTIME_URL
4. **BTP endpoint mismatch** → Corrected to agent-runtime:3000
5. **macOS head command** → Replaced with sed for compatibility

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### For Testing Without Contracts (Current Setup)
- ✅ Test ILP packet routing through admin API
- ✅ Test peer discovery and registration
- ✅ Test Nostr relay event queries
- ✅ Monitor connector health and metrics

### For Full Payment Channel Testing
1. Deploy payment channel contracts to Anvil
2. Configure `BASE_REGISTRY_ADDRESS`
3. Restart agent-runtime
4. Run full payment channel test suite
5. Verify on-chain settlement
